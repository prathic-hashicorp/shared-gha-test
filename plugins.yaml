# This file defines the release configuration for each Vault plugin. The syntax
# is as follows:
#
#   <plugin-name>:
#     enterprise: <boolean>
#     binary-release: <boolean>
#     repository: <string>
#
#     `enterprise`            - When set to true, this indicates that the plugin is
#                               closed source and is only available with Vault Enterprise.
#     `binary-release`        - When set to true, this indicates that the plugin
#                               binary will be released on https://releases.hashicorp.com/.
#     `repository` (optional) - When set, this is the GitHub repository from which the plugin
#                               is built. If unset, the plugin name is used.

# Enterprise-only plugins that release binaries
#
# These ent-only plugins have a license-enforcing mechanism in place
# for publishing as an external plugin, so we can set binary-release: true.
